### My Role

As a Product Designer at Canary, I lead projects from concept to execution, partnering closely with PMs and engineering leads to define product requirements, and collaborating with go-to-market teams. My work spans facilitating iterative design sprints, conducting field research with hotels, and presenting design solutions to leadership and executive teams.

Additionally, I help standardize design operations, evangelizing new processes, and enhancing design scalability with our design system, Canary UI, in partnership with engineering.

### [+] Digital Check-in

Designed a seamless self-service check-in solution that allows hotel guests to bypass the front desk. This product addresses guest frustration with wait times and operational inefficiencies, enabling guests to confirm reservations, upload identification, and make requests digitally, all while reducing staff workload.

[TODO: Visual — Hotel staff-facing dashboard design with guest ID photo for easy recognition, 16:9]

The staff dashboard was designed in alignment with hotel operational workflow. We wanted to translate the traditional analog process of comparing the guest payment card and ID card by placing those documents side-by-side in the digital interface.

### [+] Compendium

Developed a customizable, guest-facing digital directory for hotels to communicate key information, such as amenities, policies, and local recommendations. The product also included a "logged-in" version tailored to individual guest preferences and a public version for general hotel information.

[TODO: Visual — Mobile interface — digital directory with amenities, policies, and dining options, 9:16]

The mobile interface serves as a digital directory for hotels. Guests can easily access information about amenities, policies, dining options, and local recommendations. The design includes a personalized "logged-in" experience tied to the guest's reservation, offering tailored features like room-specific details or stay itineraries.

[TODO: Visual — Content management system (CMS) for hotel staff to customize their compendium, 16:9]

The CMS enables hotel staff to control and customize their compendium content and design. It includes tools for managing text, images, and layouts while enabling manual translations for multilingual support. Hotels can tailor the compendium to reflect their branding through customizable themes, colors, and fonts.

---

### [+] Omni-channel Communication

Improved how hotel front desk agents handle multiple communication channels (SMS, email, OTA sites). Designed a unified interface that allows staff to manage guest messages across platforms, reducing response times and ensuring consistent service.

---

### [+] International Expansion

Contributed to internationalization efforts by helping design workflows that accommodate multilingual and regional variations. Focused on creating an MVP for manual translations while setting a foundation for future auto-translation capabilities.
