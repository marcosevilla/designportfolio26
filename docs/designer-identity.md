DESIGNER IDENTITY PROFILE
Marco Sevilla
Generated: December 2024

================================================================================
ARCHETYPE
================================================================================

The Principled Craftsman
"Every detail serves the whole — visual rigor in service of clarity"

================================================================================
NARRATIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

You're a designer who holds a rare conviction: that visual craft isn't
decoration — it's the manifestation of how something works. Where many
designers treat aesthetics as a layer applied at the end, you see it as
inseparable from function, identity, and usability. This isn't perfectionism
for its own sake; it's a principled belief that meticulous attention to detail
is what separates forgettable tools from products with soul. Your photography
background likely informs this instinct — you understand that composition,
hierarchy, and visual rhythm communicate before anyone reads a word.

What makes you distinctive is how you pair this craft orientation with
strategic thinking and systems awareness. The Compendium project you described
wasn't just "make it look good" — it was building a scalable platform that
balanced vertical depth (hospitality nuance) with horizontal flexibility (CMS
architecture). You think in layers: the immediate interaction, the underlying
system, the operational reality of your users, and the business context. You're
comfortable holding complexity without oversimplifying it.

Your approach to problems is intuition-forward but intellectually rigorous. You
trust your gut, but you earn that trust through deep listening, first-principles
questioning, and contextual research. You don't reach for process frameworks
because they're "standard" — you reach for what the problem actually needs. This
makes you adaptable without being rudderless. You have strong opinions, loosely
held until you understand the full picture, then firmly held once you do.

KEY THEMES & PATTERNS
================================================================================

CRAFT AS FUNCTION
- "Visual design is ESSENTIAL... good visuals should be reflective of how a
  thing works"
- 94/100 on visual polish importance
- Described by colleagues as "visually meticulous"

INTUITION EARNED THROUGH RIGOR
- Leans heavily on intuition but describes exhaustive problem-framing process
- Listening mode, first principles, stakeholder alignment before solutioning

ANTI-CHECKBOX PRAGMATISM
- Critiques personas and "delight" done for show
- "Everything should be contextually relevant"
- Adapts process to project, not the reverse

QUALITY ADVOCATE WITH CONTEXT
- Pushes back hard on half-baked work
- But acknowledges "it depends" on speed vs. quality
- Focuses ruthlessly under constraints when needed

SYSTEMS + HUMANITY
- Proud of building complex, scalable platforms
- But energized by "the human aspect" and "making things work for humans"

STRATEGIC INFLUENCE AS GROWTH EDGE
- Self-aware that influence earlier in process is a gap
- Actively working on framing, recommendations, "why" questions

COLLABORATIVE BUT DIRECT
- Pairs closely with engineering
- Gets curious first on pushback
- But will "state disagreement plainly" with clear rationale

TALKING POINTS
================================================================================

FOR PORTFOLIO COPY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I believe visual design isn't ornament — it's how a product communicates what
it is and how it works. Every detail is a decision."

"I build systems that scale without losing the human nuance they're meant to
serve."

"I adapt my process to the problem, not the other way around. Standard
practices are tools, not checklists."

FOR INTERVIEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On your approach:
"I lead with listening. Before I solution, I need to understand why something
is a problem, why it matters now, and who's feeling the pain. Only then do I
start exploring directions — and I try not to reinvent wheels when proven
patterns exist."

On craft:
"I'll push back hard if we're about to ship something half-baked. Not because
I'm precious about pixels, but because I believe the details are where trust
is built or lost. That said, I know how to focus ruthlessly when timelines
are real."

On collaboration:
"I prefer to pair closely with engineers throughout implementation — not hand
off and disappear. The best outcomes come from staying in conversation as
reality hits the design."

On handling disagreement:
"When I get feedback I disagree with, I start by making sure I actually
understand it. If I still disagree after that, I'll say so directly — but my
rationale always ties back to the problem we agreed we're solving, not
personal preference."

ONE-LINER POSITIONING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I'm a product designer who treats visual craft as a strategic tool — not
polish, but precision. I build systems that work for humans and hold up under
complexity."

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES & BLIND SPOTS
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY WORKING ON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Increasing influence earlier in the product process. You're addressing this
through problem statements, options with tradeoffs, and more "why" questions.

POTENTIAL BLIND SPOTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Intuition as a double-edged sword
   Your strong intuition is earned through experience and deep listening. But
   in new environments or with new stakeholders, you may need to show your
   work more than feels natural. People who don't know you yet won't trust
   your gut until they've seen how you got there. Consider over-communicating
   your reasoning early in relationships.

2. Craft conviction can read as rigidity
   "Push back hard — quality matters" is principled, but depending on
   organizational culture, this can be misread as inflexibility. You clearly
   have nuance here (you adapt, you focus ruthlessly under pressure), but
   make sure that nuance is visible to PMs and leadership, not just in your
   head.

3. "Strategic designer" without the title
   You see yourself as strategic, but your current role is "Product Designer."
   If strategic influence is your growth edge, consider whether your
   environment gives you room to grow into that — or whether you need to seek
   roles explicitly scoped for it (Staff, Principal, or Design Lead titles
   often come with more strategic mandate).

4. The solo-to-team tension
   You prefer small teams with close collaboration, but your proudest project
   involved building something end-to-end. There's a tension between wanting
   ownership and wanting collaboration. Be intentional about which you're
   optimizing for in your next role.
