## 1. Case Study Content

### 1.1 Structure — Lead With the Outcome

The consensus across Julie Zhuo, Daniel Burka (GV), Nielsen Norman Group, and HubSpot Design: **lead with the outcome, not the process.**

> "The biggest mistake designers make is treating their case study like a mystery novel. Hiring managers are not reading for suspense. Put your conclusion first." — **Julie Zhuo** (ex-VP Design, Meta)

**Recommended section flow:**

| Section | Purpose | Reader Time |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Hook/Hero | Outcome + stakes in 1-2 sentences | 5 sec |
| Context Bar | Role, timeline, team, company | 10 sec |
| TL;DR Summary | Full arc in 3-4 sentences | 15 sec |
| The Problem | Business context, "why now" | 30 sec |
| Your Approach | 2-3 key design decisions with rationale | 2-3 min |
| The Solution | Annotated visuals of final work | 2-3 min |
| Impact | Metrics, quotes, behavioral changes | 1 min |
| Reflection | What you learned, what you'd change | 1 min |

**GV's key insight:** The strongest portfolios support **two reading modes** — a 60-second skim AND a 5-minute deep read. Bold headings, pull quotes, and annotated images should tell the story even without body text.

**Source:** Daniel Burka / GV Design, "Hiring a Product Designer: How to Review Portfolios," GV Library (~2016, still widely cited).

### 1.2 Organize Around Decisions, Not Phases

**Femke van Schoonhoven** (ex-Shopify, "Design Life" podcast):
> "Don't organize around phases (research, ideation, testing). Organize around the 3-5 most important decisions you made. Each decision: what were the options, why you chose what you chose, and what happened."

She also emphasizes every sentence should pass the "so what?" test. If a reader could respond "so what?" it doesn't belong.

**HubSpot Design** calls out the #1 anti-pattern — **"Process recitation"**:
> "We assume everyone uses a similar process. We want to see the thinking, not the steps."

**Source:** HubSpot Product Blog, "Portfolio Reviews Done Right" (product.hubspot.com/blog).

**Tanner Christensen** (ex-Meta, Netflix, Lyft):
> "A common mistake is assuming interviewers want a profound narrative about the product problem. We don't. We want to hear about YOUR challenges while working on the product problem."

**Source:** Tanner Christensen, "How to Strengthen Your Design Portfolio," Medium (~2019).

### 1.3 Process vs. Outcomes — The 30/70 Rule

**Sarah Doody** (UX portfolio coach): Spend **30% on process, 70% on decisions, outcomes, and reflection.** Most designers invert this.

Her framework — **"Insight to Action"**: Every research finding shown must have an explicit "and therefore I designed..." statement attached.

**Source:** Sarah Doody, sarahdoody.com, UX Notebook newsletter, UX portfolio course.

**Charli Marie** (ex-Head of Design, ConvertKit) advocates the "inverted case study":
> "Nobody cares about your sticky notes. Lead with the beautiful, polished final product to hook them, then use the process to prove you didn't just stumble into it."

**Source:** Charli Marie, YouTube + "Design Life" podcast.

### 1.4 Quantifying Impact — The Metrics Hierarchy

From **First Round Capital** (based on Meta's design hiring method):

| Tier | Type | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **1 (Strongest)** | Direct business metrics | Revenue, conversion rate changes, user growth |
| **2 (Strong)** | Indirect metrics with design connection | NPS changes, support ticket reduction, adoption rates |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | Qualitative impact | User quotes, stakeholder testimonials, feature expansion |
| **4 (Weak)** | Process metrics | Number of iterations, test sessions conducted |

**Source:** First Round Review, "An Inside Look at Facebook's Method for Hiring Designers" (review.firstround.com).

**Julie Zhuo** on the metrics problem:
> "If you can't share exact numbers, share the direction and magnitude. 'Increased conversion by over 20%' is fine. What's NOT fine is 'improved the experience' with no evidence."

**Alicja Suska** (reviewed 1000+ portfolios):
> "Only ~15% of portfolios included meaningful business metrics. Those that did were immediately more memorable. Always include context — '$3.8M CARR' means nothing without 'representing 141% YoY growth.'"

**Source:** Alicja Suska, "I Reviewed 1000+ Product Design Portfolios," Design Bootcamp / Medium (~2023).

### 1.5 The "So What?" Chain

**Indeed Design** recommends chaining "so what?" until you reach business value:

> "We reduced form completion time by 40%"
> So what?
> "More guests completed pre-check-in before arrival."
> So what?
> "Front desk staff spent 60% less time on manual data entry."
> So what?
> "Hotels could handle more check-ins per hour, directly impacting revenue per front desk employee."

The chain should be explicit in the case study. Don't make the reader do the mental math.

**Source:** Indeed Design, "The Art of Storytelling for Case Studies" (indeed.design).

### 1.6 Common Mistakes That Turn Off Hiring Managers

**Mistake #1: Process Recitation ("The Double Diamond Walk")**

**Brian Lovin** (ex-GitHub, runs staff.design):
> "The biggest red flag is when every case study has the same structure: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test. It tells me the designer follows a template, not that they think."

**Mistake #2: "I" vs. "We" Confusion**

**Julie Zhuo**:
> "When I interview, I ask directly: 'What decisions were you directly responsible for?' The ones who can't answer clearly don't get hired."

Best pattern: Use "we" for team context, "I" for your contributions. Be explicit about scope.

**Mistake #3: Only Showing the Happy Path**

**Pablo Stanley** (ex-Lyft, InVision):
> "The most interesting part of any design project is where it almost went wrong. If your case study reads like everything went to plan, I either think you're lying or you weren't involved enough to know what went wrong."

Include at least one "pivot point" — a moment the direction changed based on new information.

**Mistake #4: Generic Reflection**

**Figma's recruiter blog**:
> "When a designer writes 'I learned the importance of user research,' it tells us nothing. We want specific: 'I should have tested the dropdown with power users earlier because they had keyboard-navigation workflows we missed.'"

**Source:** Figma Blog, "Portfolio Tips from a Figma Recruiter" (figma.com/blog).

**Mistake #5: Wall of Text / No Visual Hierarchy**

**Nielsen Norman Group** (Sarah Gibbons): Recruiters scan F-pattern. Case studies that are dense walls of text are literally not being read. Use the "squint test" — squint at your case study from arm's length. If it looks like a uniform gray block, it needs more visual hierarchy.

**Source:** NN/g, "UX Portfolio Case Study Template" (nngroup.com, Sarah Gibbons, ~2022).

**Mistake #6: Too Many Case Studies**

**Dann Petty** (Epicurrence, Overtime podcast):
> "Three incredible case studies will always beat six mediocre ones. You are judged by your weakest work, not your strongest."

**Mistake #7: The Portfolio Itself Is Badly Designed**

**GV (Daniel Burka)**:
> "The portfolio IS the design test. If your case study has inconsistent spacing, low-quality images, or awkward typography, that tells me more about your design sensibility than any project you show me."

### 1.7 Length: 5 Minutes Max

- **Zhuo**: "I spend ~60 seconds deciding if I want to read. If yes, 3-5 minutes total."
- **NN/g**: 3-5 minutes to read in full. Longer needs editing.
- **Alicja Suska**: Best case studies were 800-1200 words of body text + 6-10 annotated images.

**Practical length guidelines:**

| Element | Recommended Length |
|---------|-------------------|
| Total body text | 800-1500 words |
| Problem section | 2-3 sentences (100-150 words) |
| Each key decision | 1 paragraph + 1 annotated image (100-150 words) |
| Impact section | 3-5 bullet points with metrics |
| Reflection | 3-4 bullet points (150-200 words) |
| Images/visuals | 6-10 annotated images per case study |
| Total page length | 5-8 scroll lengths on desktop |

The collapsed (non-expanded) view must tell the complete story on its own. Expanded sections add depth and proof.

### 1.8 Senior vs. Staff Level Signals

From **Intercom's IC Career Path** and **Catt Small** (*The Staff Designer*, Rosenfeld Media, 2024):

| Signal | Senior | Staff |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Problem | Solves the given problem | Frames and chooses the right problem |
| Process | Adapts process to constraints | Defines the process for the team |
| Decisions | Explains trade-offs | Shows cross-team influence |
| Impact | Connects design to business | Shows impact beyond immediate project |
| Systems | Designs screens | Designs scalable patterns used across products |
| Reflection | Specific and actionable | Forward-looking, shapes org direction |

**Rasmus Andersson** (early Figma, Inter typeface, ex-Spotify first designer):
> At Staff+ level, the portfolio shifts from "here's what I designed" to "here's how I shaped the direction." The projects themselves become less important than the patterns across projects.

### 1.9 Handling NDA'd / Confidential Work

**Julie Zhuo**: "At Facebook, we couldn't share unreleased work. But we could always share: the problem space, team structure, our approach, constraints, and the outcome in general terms. That's enough."

**Figma's recruiter**: "We'd rather see one well-told story about a redacted project than a beautiful case study about a school project."

**Techniques:**

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Anonymize | Product is secret but problem type isn't |
| Redact visuals | Can show UI but not data/content |
| Recreate | Can't show real screens — rebuild with fake data, label "recreation" |
| Abstract | Even the product category is sensitive |
| Focus on process | Nothing visual can be shown |
| Get permission | Best option — many companies have portfolio exception policies |

---

## 2. Homepage & Positioning

### 2.1 The 10-Second Rule

**Sarah Doody**: Recruiters form judgment in **under 10 seconds.** If the homepage doesn't immediately communicate who you are, what you do, and evidence you're good at it — they leave.

**Tobias van Schneider** (co-founder Semplice, ex-Spotify): **The first 2-3 seconds determine if a recruiter stays or bounces.** Above the fold must answer: "Should I keep scrolling?"

**Nielsen Norman Group**: The homepage must immediately establish the designer's current role/focus and link to project work. Avoid splash pages, purely visual homepages without text context, or anything that delays getting to the work.

### 2.2 What Belongs Above the Fold

Consensus from NN/g, Doody, van Schneider, and **Jared Spool** (Center Centre):

1. **Your name** — not a logo, not a clever alias
2. **A positioning statement** (1-2 sentences)
3. **Visual evidence of your work** — project cards or thumbnails visible or nearly visible
4. **A clear path to the work** — navigation or natural scroll

**What to avoid:** Long philosophy paragraphs, animations that delay content by more than 1-2 seconds, "Welcome to my portfolio" messaging, auto-playing video that doesn't immediately show work.

### 2.3 Writing a Compelling Bio / Positioning Statement

**Tobias van Schneider's formula:** `[Role] who [unique value proposition] at [context]` — one sentence.

**Cap Watkins** (ex-VP Design, BuzzFeed):
> "The best positioning statements name the type of problems the designer solves, not just the craft they practice. 'Product designer' is generic. 'Designer who makes enterprise complexity feel simple' tells a story."

**Fabricio Teixeira** (co-founder UX Collective):
> "Your bio should sound like you talking, not like a LinkedIn summary. Read it out loud. If it sounds like a committee wrote it, rewrite it."

**Simon Pan** (ex-Google/Uber) identified common bio failures:
- "Passionate about design" — everyone says it
- "I create delightful experiences" — vague
- "UX/UI Designer" — a title, not a positioning

**What works instead:**
- **Specificity** — name the domain, the type of product, the scale
- **Evidence embedded in the statement** — "I design platforms serving millions of hotel guests"
- **Point of view** — what you believe about design that others might not

### 2.4 Project Card Best Practices

**NN/g (Sarah Gibbons):** Show project title, your role, company name, one-line outcome, and a visual preview (the most important element).

**Tobias van Schneider**: "The thumbnail is an ad for your case study. Use a hero image showing the most impressive final output, not a process shot."

**Adham Dannaway** (*The UX Portfolio Handbook*): Include one compelling metric or outcome on the card itself. Not just "F&B Ordering" but "F&B Ordering — 100% design ownership, scaled to 4 hotel brands."

**Bestfolios analysis** of top-performing portfolios found most-clicked cards share:
1. High-quality visual with clear device mockups
2. Title that implies a story, not just a product name
3. Brief descriptor hinting at challenge or outcome
4. Visual differentiation between cards (different color palettes per project)

### 2.5 How Hiring Managers Actually Scan

**Michael Slade** (Design Manager, Google):
> "I spend about 30 seconds on the homepage. I'm looking for: can this person design? Relevant problems? Evidence of impact? Then I click the most relevant-looking project."

**Sarah Doody's data:**
- 60% look at homepage + 1 case study
- 25% look at homepage + 2 case studies
- 15% explore more broadly
- **Average total portfolio time: ~4 minutes**

**Dann Petty**: "I look at the homepage for 5 seconds. Then I pick the most interesting project and spend 2-3 minutes on it."

**Meg Robichaud** (ex-Staff Designer, Shopify) — the **"two case study rule"**: Most hiring managers read only 1-2 case studies. Card order is a priority queue — strongest story first.

**NN/g eye-tracking:** F-pattern scanning. Images are fixation magnets — eyes go to images before text. Project thumbnails are the most critical homepage element.

### 2.6 Personality: The 70/30 Rule

**Fabricio Teixeira**: "Be human, not 'professional.' 70% work and craft, 30% human touches and personality."

**Julie Zhuo**: "Portfolio personality signals culture fit and collaboration style — things you cannot get from a resume."

**Tobias van Schneider**: "Your portfolio should feel like meeting you for coffee, not reading your resume."

Key insight from top portfolios: personality is expressed through **design decisions in the portfolio itself**, not just bio copy.

### 2.7 What Top Designers' Homepages Do Differently

| Designer | Approach | Lesson |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Rasmus Andersson** (rsms.me — early Figma, Inter) | Extremely minimal. No animation. Pure confidence. | At a high craft level, less is dramatically more |
| **Karolis Kosas** (Stripe) | Visual-first cards with high-fidelity mockups | Mockup quality on cards IS the first impression |
| **Rauno Freiberg** (Vercel) | Portfolio itself is a design artifact, every interaction intentional | Interaction craft signals engineering collaboration ability |
| **Adrien Griveau** (founding designer, Linear) | Minimal, fast, typographically strong | Visual language implicitly says "this is the quality bar I bring" |
| **Henry Modisett** (VP Design, Perplexity) | Editorial approach — writes about design thinking | For leadership roles, show strategic thinking, not just execution |

**Common thread:** They load fast. Work is visible within 1-2 scrolls. Visual quality is exceptional. Clear point of view. Ruthlessly edited.

### 2.8 Homepage Bio vs. Separate About Page

**NN/g (Page Laubheimer):** Include a brief positioning statement (1-2 sentences) on the homepage. Full story goes on a separate About page.

**Sarah Doody**: Homepage includes "just enough about you to establish trust." Full bio on a separate page.

**Both are needed:**
1. **Homepage bio**: Brief, expandable, establishes credibility quickly
2. **About page**: Photo, narrative bio, philosophy, career journey, personal touches, what you're looking for

**What goes on About, NOT homepage:** Your photo, career timeline, design principles at length, personal interests at length, what you want in your next role.

### 2.9 Navigation

**Consensus (3-5 nav items):**

**Primary nav:** Work, About, Contact (or email link)

**Optional:** Writing/Blog, Play/Experiments

**Do NOT put in nav:** Resume (download link on About), Skills/Services (integrate into bio or case studies), Testimonials (weave into case studies).

---

## 3. Visual Design & Craft

### 3.1 Typography — The #1 Craft Signal

**Tobias van Schneider**: Typography is the first thing a design-literate reviewer notices. A portfolio with excellent typography and mediocre imagery will outperform one with excellent imagery and mediocre typography. Typography signals whether you understand design systems at a foundational level.

**Rasmus Andersson**: His site (rsms.me) is almost entirely typographic — zero decorative imagery — and reads as one of the most "designed" sites in the industry. The craft is in spacing, weight hierarchy, and rhythm.

**The "one family, many weights" approach** is now dominant among craft-focused designers (Rauno Freiberg, Paco Coursey, Linear). Weight and opacity create more sophistication than mixing 3 typefaces.

**Emil Kowalski** (Sonner creator): Font pairing should be "invisible" — the reader should never notice the fonts, only the hierarchy.

**Practical font pairing rules (consensus):**
1. Maximum two typeface families (adding mono for code/metadata is acceptable)
2. Contrast in structure, harmony in proportion (geometric display + humanist body or vice versa)
3. **Weight is your most powerful tool** — 400 vs 700 creates more hierarchy than two different typefaces
4. Tighten tracking on large display type (-0.02em to -0.04em). Loosen on small caps/metadata (+0.05em to +0.1em)
5. Test hierarchy in grayscale — if it doesn't read without color, it doesn't work

**Readability specifics:**

| Property | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Body text size | 18-22px (case studies), 16px acceptable for nav/UI chrome |
| Line height (body) | 1.5-1.6 |
| Line length | 66-75 characters (~650-700px) |
| Hierarchy method | Size + weight + opacity, not color alone |

**Type sizes for case study pages:**

| Element | Size | Line-height |
|---------|------|-------------|
| H1 (case study title) | 48-72px | 1.1-1.2 |
| H2 (section headers) | 32-40px | 1.2-1.35 |
| H3 (sub-sections) | 24-28px | 1.3-1.4 |
| Body text | 18-22px | 1.5-1.6 |
| Pull quotes / callouts | 28-36px | 1.3-1.4 |
| Captions | 14-16px | 1.4 |
| Metadata labels | 12-14px uppercase, letter-spaced | — |
| Impact metrics | 48-80px bold, accent color | 1.1 |

### 3.2 Color Strategy — Restraint as Strength

**Karolis Kosas** (Stripe): Almost entirely monochromatic portfolio. Color comes only through project work itself. Portfolio chrome is black/white/gray — case study imagery carries all the color.

**Rauno Freiberg**: Site is essentially black, white, grayscale. Color is earned through interaction, not applied as decoration.

**The principle:** Portfolio chrome should be a neutral frame. Color serves three purposes:
1. **Accent/interactive states** — one color, used consistently
2. **Case study identity** — each project gets its own color via hero gradients
3. **Data/metrics** — drawing the eye to impact numbers

**Dark vs. Light mode:**
- Van Schneider: Dark mode feels more "premium" and makes imagery pop, but has readability risk for long text. If case studies are text-heavy, default to light.
- ~60-70% of users prefer light mode for long-form reading, but design industry skews dark
- The default a first-time visitor sees should be whichever makes case study hero images look best

### 3.3 Image Presentation — The Make-or-Break Factor

**Alicja Suska**: The single most common reason portfolios fail — low-quality or poorly presented imagery.
> "Hiring managers make a gut judgment in 3 seconds. If the first screenshot looks like a raw Figma export with no context, they mentally categorize you as junior."

**The "three-layer" presentation system (from top portfolios):**

1. **Hero layer:** Full-bleed, device mockup, brand-color background, dramatic presentation. The magazine cover.
2. **Key decision layer:** Medium-width images with clear annotations (arrows, callouts, labels). Shows *what you designed and why.* Captions mandatory.
3. **Process layer:** Text-width, less polished. Sketches, wireframes, Figma screenshots, user flows. Shows *how you think.*

**Display widths:**

| Pattern | Width | Use For |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Full-bleed | 100vw | Heroes, dramatic breaks |
| Wide contained | ~1200px | Primary mockups, key screens |
| Text-width | ~700px | Process artifacts, sketches |
| Side-by-side | 50/50 or 60/40 | Before/after, comparisons |

**Rules:**
- 4-10 key screens per case study
- **Every image needs a caption** — never drop screenshots without context
- Device mockups for heroes/thumbnails; minimal frames for inline images
- Short video clips (10-30s, autoplay muted, looping) for interaction demos
- Before/after: side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile, with clear labels
- Annotation is non-negotiable — GV specifically says an image without context is a missed opportunity

### 3.4 Layout — The "Expanding and Contracting" Rhythm

The most engaging long-form pages alternate content widths:

```
[Full-bleed hero image with title overlay]
[Metadata bar: role, timeline, team, tools]
[Brief intro text — narrow column (~650px)]
[Full-bleed or wide image — final product showcase]
[Section heading + body text — narrow column]
[Medium-width process image with caption]
[Pull quote or key metric callout — wide, centered]
[Device mockup presentation — contained]
[Results / impact section with metrics]
[Next project link]
```

This "narrow text / wide imagery" breathing pattern is what creates visual interest. A page stuck at one width feels monotonous.

**Vertical rhythm (8px base unit):**
- Body paragraph spacing: 24px (3 units)
- Section breaks within case study: 64-96px (8-12 units)
- Major section breaks: 96-128px (12-16 units)
- Between hero and first content: 48-64px

**Whitespace principle** (Rauno Freiberg): If you think you have enough whitespace, double it, then reduce by 25%.

### 3.5 Motion — When It Helps vs. Hurts

**The spectrum:**
- **Rauno Freiberg:** Motion is central. Dynamic backgrounds, sounds, cursor effects. Proves he can build. Target role: design engineer.
- **Karolis Kosas:** Minimal motion. Subtle fade-ins, clean hovers. Work speaks through imagery and writing. Target role: product designer.

Both are exceptional. The question: **What does each piece of motion demonstrate?** If it demonstrates a skill you want to be hired for, keep it. If decorative, cut it.

**Emil Kowalski's motion principles:**
1. Motion should feel inevitable, not surprising
2. Duration scales with distance: small elements 150-200ms, medium 200-350ms, large 300-500ms
3. Spring physics over duration-based easing
4. Exit animations faster than enter (enter 300ms, exit 200ms)

**Keep (demonstrates craft):**
- Scroll-triggered fade-ins (subtle, expected)
- Spring-based hover states (physics understanding)
- Progress bar on case studies (functional)
- Page transitions (if smooth and fast)

**Evaluate carefully:**
- Background texture animation (impressive but potentially distracting from case study content)
- Section snap physics (novel but could frustrate readers wanting to scroll freely)
- Multi-phase hero intro (beautiful but hiring managers are time-constrained)

**The Tobias van Schneider test:** "If a hiring manager has 60 seconds, does this animation help them or slow them down?"

**Figma recruiter blog:** "Over-designed portfolios are a red flag. If you spent more time on the portfolio's interactions than on presenting your work clearly, we notice."

### 3.6 Case Study Visual Storytelling

**Van Schneider's "magazine spread" model:** Design each section as a pairing of text and imagery that tells a micro-story together:
- Every section should have at least one supporting visual
- Visuals placed *next to* the text they support, not gathered at the end
- Alternate: text block, image, text block, wide image, callout

**Diagrams and flows:** Simplify for portfolio. Full Figma flows are too complex. Extract 5-7 key decision points. Custom vector diagrams with your portfolio's typography signal more craft than Figma screenshots.

**Annotated screenshots (the highest-value visual):** A screenshot with 3-4 numbered callouts communicates more than a paragraph. Frameworks:
1. Numbered callouts on image + legend below
2. Arrow + label pointing to specific elements
3. Side-by-side: image on one side, bulleted annotations on other

Never use long paragraphs below a screenshot expecting readers to map text to image.

**Video prototypes:**
- 10-15 seconds, auto-playing, muted, looping
- One interaction per clip
- Inline with text, not in a gallery
- Compressed MP4 or WebM (not GIF)
- Clear caption explaining what viewer sees

### 3.7 Mobile Responsiveness

**30-50% of initial portfolio views happen on mobile.** A recruiter shares your link in Slack, the hiring manager taps it between meetings. If the mobile experience is poor, you're eliminated before they reach desktop.

**Alicja Suska:** "Beautiful desktop portfolios that are completely broken on mobile — instant rejection signal."

**Key principles:**
1. Case study hero images must be compelling at 360px width
2. Touch targets: 44x44px minimum (Apple HIG, WCAG 2.5.5)
3. Body text 16-18px on mobile, generous line height
4. Reduce/disable heavy animations on mobile (battery + performance)
5. Test on real devices — Chrome DevTools misses performance issues and iOS Safari quirks

### 3.8 Performance

**Images:**
- WebP or AVIF format
- Never lazy-load the hero image (LCP element) — preload it
- `loading="lazy"` on all below-fold images
- Always set width/height on `<img>` to prevent layout shift
- Use BlurHash or LQIP placeholders

**Budgets:**
- Total page weight: <3MB before lazy loading
- Above-the-fold: <1MB
- Core Web Vitals: LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, INP <200ms

**Animation:**
- Prefer CSS animations over JS
- Use `transform` and `opacity` only (cheapest for GPU)
- Test on real mid-range Android devices

### 3.9 Accessibility as Design Maturity

**Catt Small** (*The Staff Designer*): "Junior designers treat accessibility as a checklist at the end. Senior designers bake it in from the start. Staff designers advocate for it as a design philosophy."

**What design-literate hiring managers look for:**
1. Color contrast that actually works (WCAG AA)
2. Keyboard navigation throughout with visible focus states
3. Semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, headings in order)
4. `prefers-reduced-motion` support
5. Custom focus-visible styles matching your design language

### 3.10 Trends (2024-2026) vs. Timeless Principles

**Timeless (always do):**
- Clean typography, generous whitespace, high-quality images
- Fast loading, mobile-optimized
- Clear visual hierarchy (passes grayscale test)
- Portfolio's own design quality as proxy for skill
- Content before chrome — work is the hero, not the portfolio itself

**Current trends (may date within 2-3 years):**
- Dark mode support / theme customization
- Bento grid layouts for project cards
- Glassmorphism/frosted glass (stabilizing, no longer novel)
- Cursor-following effects (increasingly common, execution quality differentiates)
- Oversized typography (stabilizing)
- Monospace for "technical" feel (peaked 2023-2024)

### 3.11 Reference Portfolios with Exceptional Visual Design

| Designer | Company | What Makes It Work |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Rauno Freiberg** (rauno.me) | Vercel | Motion IS the thesis. Every interaction proves building skill. Custom cursor, dynamic backgrounds, sound. |
| **Karolis Kosas** (karoliskosas.com) | Stripe | Extreme restraint. Zero decorative animation. Work is always the protagonist. |
| **Paco Coursey** (paco.me) | Design Engineer | Most minimal top portfolio. Almost entirely text. Typography is impeccable. |
| **Oscar Dumlao** (oscardumlao.com) | ex-Figma, Reve | 40+ projects without overwhelm. Visual dominance — imagery fills viewport. |
| **Shu Ding** (shud.in) | Vercel | Art-gallery approach. Each page is standalone creative piece. Works for design engineering. |
| **Joseph Zhang** (joseph.cv) | ex-Notion, Cognition | Hover-to-preview reduces clicks. CV approach blends resume info + visuals. |
| **Tobias van Schneider** (vanschneider.com) | Semplice | Practices what he preaches. Strong personal brand extending across all touchpoints. |
| **Adrien Griveau** (adriengriveau.com) | Linear (founding designer) | Linear's restraint and precision evident. Visual language = quality bar. |

**Curated collections:** Pafolios (pafolios.com, 685+), Bestfolios (bestfolios.medium.com), DesignerUp, SiteBuilderReport.

## 4. Prioritized Action List

Ranked by likely impact on hiring outcomes.

### Tier 1 — Non-Negotiable (kills candidacy if wrong)

1. **Get real images into project cards and case studies.** Every source agrees this is the single most impactful change. Gray placeholders are an immediate bounce trigger.
2. **Add a 3-4 sentence TL;DR to each case study hero.** Supports the 60-second skim (Zhuo, GV, NN/g).
3. **Mobile experience must not frustrate.** Test on real devices.
4. **Fast loading.** Optimize images aggressively. <3MB total page weight.

### Tier 2 — Strong Differentiators

5. **Sharpen the positioning statement.** "I design software in San Francisco" is clean but undifferentiated. Incorporate your point of view.
6. **Restructure case studies around decisions, not chronology** (Femke, HubSpot, Tanner Christensen).
7. **Pull your strongest metric into each card.** "$3.8M CARR" or "100% ownership" visible at card level (Suska, Dannaway).
8. **Trim case studies to ~1000 words body text.**
9. **Add one rejected/failed direction per case study** (Zhuo, Pablo Stanley).
10. **Annotate every visual** — no screenshot without context.

### Tier 3 — Craft Signals

11. **Elevate cross-project patterns** — shared patterns (builder layouts, translation pickers, live previews) are the strongest staff-level signal (Catt Small, Intercom).
12. **Consider cutting to 4-5 case studies** — "judged by your weakest project" (Dann Petty).
13. **Add the "So What?" chain to metrics** — connect decisions to business outcomes explicitly.
14. **Evaluate intro animation timing** — 5-phase hero takes several seconds. Hiring managers are impatient scanners.
15. **Add next-project links** at bottom of every case study — critical for retention.

### Tier 4 — Delight (memorable but won't compensate for gaps above)

16. Background texture animation
17. Theme customization (color palettes, font pairings)
18. Dynamic bio grid
19. Sound design
