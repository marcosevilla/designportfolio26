# Portfolio Priorities & Critique

A prioritization framework for completing Marco's portfolio before job applications.

**Goal**: Job-ready portfolio in 1 week
**Context**: Product Designer with 2+ years at Canary Technologies, targeting senior IC or lead roles

---

## Current State Assessment

### What's Strong

1. **Case Study Structure**: All 4 implemented case studies (F&B Ordering, Check-in, General Task, Design System) have:
   - Rich narrative content with problem/solution framing
   - Stats and metrics for credibility
   - Expandable sections for depth without overwhelming
   - Sticky TOC for navigation
   - Smooth scroll animations and polish

2. **Visual Design**: The portfolio itself demonstrates design craft:
   - Perlin noise background animation
   - Frosted glass cards with parallax
   - Clean typography hierarchy
   - Consistent color system via CSS variables

3. **Content Depth**: F&B Ordering case study is particularly strong:
   - Clear ownership narrative (100% design ownership)
   - Specific design decisions with rationale
   - Research insights with direct quotes
   - Reflection showing growth mindset

### What's Weak

1. **No Real Visuals**: ~67 ImagePlaceholders across 6 case studies with gray boxes
   - This is the single biggest credibility gap
   - Recruiters will bounce without seeing actual work

2. ~~**Missing Strongest Work**~~: ✅ Compendium and Upsells now migrated and live

3. **Placeholder Content**: Check-in case study is notably thinner than others
   - Less specific about ownership level
   - Missing key decisions section
   - Could be strengthened or deprioritized

4. ~~**Homepage Ordering**~~: ✅ Now leads with F&B → Compendium → Upsells

| **Add real stats to Check-in** | Currently the weakest case study | 1 hour |

**Tier 1 Total**: ~6-10 hours

### Tier 2: Polish Before Interviews

Nice-to-have for when you're getting callbacks:

## Recommended Case Study Order

Based on strength of story, metrics, and recency:

| Order | Case Study | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | **F&B Ordering** | 100% ownership, newest, clear metrics, strong prototype story |
| 2 | **Compendium** | Platform thinking, $1M CARR, 18-month scope shows growth |
| 3 | **Upsells Forms** | Workflow design, "Dream come true" quote, $3.8M CARR |
| 4 | **Check-in** | Enterprise scale (Marriott, Best Western), good for volume story |
| 5 | **General Task** | Startup experience, Y Combinator validation, but older (2022) |
| 6 | **Design System** | Foundational work, but less differentiated |

**Why this order:**
- Leads with Canary work (where you currently are)
- Front-loads ownership and metrics
- Shows platform/systems thinking early
- Earlier work comes after establishing credibility

## What Makes a Strong Portfolio at Your Level

At 2+ years experience targeting senior/lead roles, reviewers are looking for:

### Must Demonstrate
1. **Ownership**: Clear "I did this" vs. "We did this"
2. **Impact**: Metrics tied to business outcomes
3. **Craft**: Visual polish that matches the role you want
4. **Thinking**: Rationale behind decisions, not just output
5. **Growth**: What you learned, what you'd do differently

### Differentiators
1. **Systems thinking**: Platform architecture, not just features
2. **Cross-functional influence**: Working with PM, eng, sales
3. **Enterprise context**: Scale, constraints, stakeholder management
4. **Technical depth**: Code prototypes, design system contributions

### Your Strengths to Emphasize
- Code prototypes (F&B Ordering, Upsells) — rare for designers
- Platform architecture (Compendium as hub for entire guest experience)
- Metrics ownership ($1M, $3.8M CARR)
- Full ownership ("100% design ownership" narrative)

## Red Flags to Avoid

| Red Flag | Your Current Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| No visuals | HIGH (39 placeholders) | P0 hero exports |
| Vague ownership | LOW | Already clear in content |
| No metrics | LOW | Stats are strong |
| All old work | MEDIUM | Migrate Canary case studies |
| Too many case studies | LOW | 6 is appropriate |
| No reflection | LOW | Reflection sections exist |
| Broken links/bugs | UNKNOWN | Day 7 review |

---

## Questions to Answer in Every Case Study

Use this checklist when reviewing each case study:

- [ ] Can a reader understand what I did in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Is my ownership level crystal clear?
- [ ] Are there real visuals (not placeholders)?
- [ ] Is there at least one compelling metric?
- [ ] Do I explain WHY, not just WHAT?
- [ ] Is there something memorable (quote, insight, prototype)?
- [ ] Does the reflection show self-awareness?

## Specific Gaps by Case Study

### F&B Ordering
- **Missing**: Real visuals (18 placeholders)
- **Strong**: Everything else — this is your best case study
- **Action**: Prioritize P0 and P1 exports here

### Check-in
- **Missing**: Specific ownership claims, key decisions section
- **Weak**: Reads more like a product overview than a case study
- **Action**: Add 2-3 specific design decisions with rationale, or deprioritize

### General Task
- **Missing**: Real visuals (8 placeholders)
- **Weak**: Older work (2022), may feel dated
- **Strong**: Y Combinator validation, research methodology
- **Action**: Export visuals but don't over-invest

### Design System
- **Missing**: Real visuals (8 placeholders)
- **Strong**: Clear impact, process documentation
- **Action**: Export visuals, position as foundational work

### Compendium ✅ Migrated
- **Strong**: $1M CARR, 82% adoption, platform architecture
- **Missing**: Real visuals (~16 placeholders)
- **Action**: Export P0 and P1 visuals

### Upsells ✅ Migrated
- **Strong**: $3.8M CARR, "Dream come true" quote, code prototype
- **Missing**: Real visuals (~12 placeholders)
- **Action**: Export P0 and P1 visuals
